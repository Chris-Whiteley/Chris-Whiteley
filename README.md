## 👋 Hi, I'm Chris

Experienced Java developer with a passion for clean design, Spring, and event-driven systems.

I build reusable Java libraries — including annotation-based event routers that support both in-process and cross-service messaging in microservice architectures.

**Tech I work with**
- Java (Spring, event-driven systems, microservices)
- Python (data analytics, ML-style workflows)
- Node / NestJS
- Kafka, CI/CD, cloud-native tooling

**Outside of work**
🐕 Dog walks  
⛳ Golf  
🧠 Over-engineering side projects
